# Righteousness
No Authority except God The Most Just. 
## Why authority is most important to be right?
Remember what caused Adam to be expelled from heaven. 
The first decree upon Adam (from his only Authority God) was:
`[2:35] Sahih International
And We said, "O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat therefrom in [ease and] abundance from wherever you will. But do not approach this tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers."
`
But Shatan appeared to Adam with a false claim of some authority to guide (shall I direct) him to eternity:
`[20:120] Sahih International
Then Satan whispered to him; he said, "O Adam, shall I direct you to the tree of eternity and possession that will not deteriorate?"
`
And Adam inclined toward that and slipped from his position. 
`[2:36] Sahih International
But Satan caused them to slip out of it and removed them from that [condition] in which they had been. And We said, "Go down, [all of you], as enemies to one another, and you will have upon the earth a place of settlement and provision for a time."
