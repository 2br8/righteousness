No Authority except God The Most Just.
## Why authority is the most important thing to do right?
Remember what caused Adam to be expelled from heaven.

#### The first decree upon Adam (from his only Authority God) was:

*[2:35] Sahih International*
> And We said, "O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat
> therefrom in [ease and] abundance from wherever you will. But do not
> approach this tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers."
 
#### But Shatan appeared to Adam with a false claim of some authority to guide (shall I direct) him to eternity:  

*[20:120] Sahih International*
> Then Satan whispered to him; he said, "O Adam, shall I direct you to
> the tree of eternity and possession that will not deteriorate?"

#### And Adam inclined toward that false authority and slipped from his position.

*[2:36] Sahih International*
> But Satan caused them to slip out of it and removed them from that
> [condition] in which they had been. And We said, "Go down, [all of
> you], as enemies to one another, and you will have upon the earth a
> place of settlement and provision for a time."

#### So giving any scope or consider any other as authority even partially will make us do wrong. 

Prophets never stated any wrong or mixed content claiming any authority like shatan. Rather they just
passed the decrees as it is. So following them is following God. Now there is no prophet but we are blessed we have
God's decrees compiled among us intact. 
#### Should we allow any other contents (in the name of prophet or in the name of so called proven preserving methodology) that may create scopes to mix-up with decrees and become a false authority? 
Is it not like creating a backdoor willingly for the shatan so that he can play with decrees and create false authority by giving false meaning to them. 
#### Better we look first is there any decree given by God to preserve life style or day to day conversations of Prophets. If this is not than definitely we are not following the God's Authority but inclining toward a false authority again. 
In short who permitted to preserve life style or day to day conversations of Prophets? If not God, we deny all other authority.
